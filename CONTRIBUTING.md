Additionally:
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use docstrings for all public classes, methods, and functions
- Keep line length to a maximum of 88 characters

- Avoid hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Document security considerations for new features
- Include appropriate input validation
- When possible, include references to relevant security standards or papers

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for documentation.
- Reference function and variable names using backticks: `functionName()` or `variableName`.
- Use code blocks with the appropriate language specified for code examples.
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tempora.git
